 In this article we will talk about wiggers. what is a wigger? A wigger is an ancient creature known by the ancient Egyptians as evil spirits. Wiggers have haunted many of the ancient peoples of their day, mostly by maxing and rebelling against the governments. "Those wiggers", said head Dr. Joojeet, "they just kept maxing in right in their faces." even when they were shot at by the elite archers of Ethiopia, they would not stop. The wiggers were a very big issue back then even though their traces were only found in a small portion in Africa, they still managed to spread fear all the way into what is today easter Russia, China and even in the Americas. After their long terror on humanity, the wiggers were eventually wiped out by unknown causes in the late 200s AD.  </p>
